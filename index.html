        <h3>New Season of Sky is Coming</h3>
        <h4>
          season of shattering starts on Monday, 02 September 2024, 4:00 A.M

        <p>
          <i>
            The wounds of the past are never far from sight. <br />
            <br />
            The light around us is in constant motion. Who could not see it? Who
            could not feel the joy of its movement? <br />
            <br />
            Once, we guided the migrating flocks. Once, behemoths flew alongside
            us in peace. And then we took the light from the wind. The behemoths
            that remained were only the monuments to ourselves. Our cities shone
            with a captive glow. We were enraptured as we taught our machines to
            bind and hoard. <br />
            <br />
            The world of the present can be healed, but our past cannot be
            undone. Jagged remnants lie in our wake, and even for the mountain
            it is too much to hold.</i
